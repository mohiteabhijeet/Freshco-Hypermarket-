# Freshco-Hypermarket-Analysis
Freshco Hypermarket, situated in HSR, Bangalore, has established itself as a prominent supermarket in the region, catering to a wide range of customers. In response to evolving customer needs and to enhance convenience, Freshco introduced a home delivery service in the year 2021. To ensure seamless operations and optimize customer satisfaction, the store diligently maintained a comprehensive transaction data sheet, containing detailed information at the order level.
In this project I have performed data analysis with availabe datasets to analyze performance at order level, completion rate, customer level and at delivery level. 
To perform this analysis I have used Microsoft Excel as a primary tool and Microsoft Word to summarize my findings; in addition to this I have created a video presentation to share my findings about this project.
